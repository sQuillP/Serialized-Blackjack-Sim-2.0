- everyone is dealt 2 cards face up, dealer gets a face down card.

- face cards are equal to 10, ace can be either 1 or 11

- if your card total is 21, then you win 1.5x your bet from the dealer.

- if your card total is greater than 21, then you lost (bust)

- if you stand, your turn is over


- dealer will always go last.
- if the dealer wins, everybody except those who have 21 from their first 2 cards will lose, otherwise it is a tie.
- if the dealer card total is 17 or higher they must stand.
- if the dealer gets a 16 or lower, they must take another card when it is their turn.

- soft hand means you have an ace, hard means you don't have an ace.
